# Week 3 – Country Development Clustering using K-Means, DBSCAN and PCA

## Overview

This project focuses on applying unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze socio-economic and health indicators of different countries. Since clustering does not require predefined target labels, the objective is to discover hidden patterns and group countries with similar characteristics.

The project uses K-Means clustering, DBSCAN, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and clustering evaluation techniques to identify similarities among countries based on economic, health, and development indicators. The analysis helps identify developed countries, developing economies, and underdeveloped regions that may require additional support.

## Dataset

**Dataset Used:** Country Data Dataset

The dataset contains socio-economic and health indicators such as:

- Child Mortality
- Exports
- Health Expenditure
- Imports
- Income
- Inflation
- Life Expectancy
- Total Fertility
- GDP per Capita

These indicators are used to group countries into meaningful clusters.

## Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on country level indicators.
- Handle missing values and duplicate records.
- Convert columns into appropriate numerical formats.
- Standardize the data using StandardScaler.
- Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
- Build a K-Means clustering model.
- Evaluate clustering quality using Silhouette Score.
- Implement DBSCAN for comparative clustering analysis.
- Apply Principal Component Analysis to reduce dimensionality.
- Visualize clusters using a two dimensional scatter plot.
- Identify highly developed countries, developing economies, and underdeveloped regions.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading and Inspection

The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and inspected to understand its structure and available features.

### 2. Data Cleaning

Duplicate records were removed, numerical columns were converted to appropriate data types, and missing values were handled using median imputation.

### 3. Feature Scaling

StandardScaler was applied to standardize all numerical features and ensure equal contribution of variables during clustering.

### 4. Elbow Method

An optimization loop was used to calculate inertia values for k values ranging from 2 to 10. The Elbow Method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

### 5. K-Means Clustering

The K-Means algorithm was trained using three clusters to group countries with similar characteristics.

### 6. Cluster Evaluation

Silhouette Score was calculated to evaluate the quality and separation of the clusters.

### 7. DBSCAN Clustering

A DBSCAN model was implemented to compare density based clustering with centroid based clustering.

### 8. Principal Component Analysis

PCA was used to reduce the high dimensional data into two principal components for visualization.

### 9. Cluster Interpretation

The clusters were analyzed to identify:

- Highly developed countries
- Developing countries
- Underdeveloped countries
- Countries requiring economic and healthcare support

## Results

- K-Means successfully divided countries into meaningful groups.
- Cluster 0 represented highly developed countries with high income and GDP.
- Cluster 1 represented underdeveloped countries with high child mortality and lower income.
- Cluster 2 represented developing countries with moderate economic indicators.
- The Silhouette Score indicated reasonably good cluster separation.
- PCA visualization showed distinguishable country groups.

## Key Learnings

- Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
- Unsupervised learning concepts.
- K-Means clustering.
- Elbow Method for cluster selection.
- Silhouette Score evaluation.
- Density based clustering using DBSCAN.
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA.
- Cluster interpretation and visualization.
- Socio-economic data analysis.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze country level development indicators. K-Means and DBSCAN helped identify meaningful country groups while PCA provided clear visualization of cluster separation. The analysis highlights how clustering can be used to discover hidden patterns in data and support data driven decision making.
